How to Save the data (Using Array and object) in React ?
    In React you save data inside State.
    State is the only correct place to store data that should change and re-render UI.
    Array and Object also can be stored inside State same like string and number.

Example: Saving data using Array inside State
    function App() {
        const [students, setStudents] = React.useState(["Sandeep", "Ravi"]);

        function addStudent() {
            setStudents([...students, "Kumar"]); // spread operator used to add new value
        }

        return (
            <>
            <button onClick={addStudent}>Add Student</button>
            {students.map((stu) => <div>{stu}</div>)}
            </>
        );
    }

Note Important Point:
    ->You never modify array directly (students.push).
    ->You always create new array and update state.

Example: Saving data using Object inside State
    function StudentDetails() {
        const [student, setStudent] = React.useState({
            name: "Sandeep",
            dept: "Computer Technology",
            year: 3
        });

        function updateDept() {
            setStudent({
            ...student,
            dept: "IT"   // update only one value in object
            });
        }

        return (
            <>
            <h3>{student.name}</h3>
            <h4>{student.dept}</h4>
            <button onClick={updateDept}>Change Department</button>
            </>
        );
    }

Here also again we do not modify object directly.
We use ...student spread and then change specific key.

Main Rules
    What you save	Example
    String	        "Hello"
    Number	         10
    Array	         []
    Object	         {}

React can store anything inside state.
But always update using setState function (never edit directly).

In short answer (Interview type):
    In React, data is saved using State. We can store array or object 
in state and update using the setter method. We must always create new 
array/object using spread operator and then update it, because React state 
is immutable.

What is State in React?
    State is a special built-in React feature that stores data 
that can change over time and affects what gets displayed on the screen.
    Whenever state changes 
        → React automatically re-renders the component with the latest updated data.

Simple Definition :-
    ->State is a way to store dynamic data in a React component. 
    ->When the state updates, the UI updates automatically.

Why State is needed?
    Because in websites data changes often:
    user typing value
    clicking button
    toggling dark mode
    storing form input
    adding messages (chat)
    increasing score in game
    State helps React track these values.

Syntax
    const [stateName, setStateName] = React.useState(initialValue);

Part	        Meaning
stateName	    variable that stores current value
setStateName	function used to update state
initialValue	default starting value

Example
    function Counter() {
    const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0);

    function increase() {
        setCount(count + 1); // updating state
    }

    return (
        <>
        <h1>{count}</h1>
        <button onClick={increase}>Increase</button>
        </>
    );
    }
When button is clicked → setCount() changes state → UI updates automatically.
